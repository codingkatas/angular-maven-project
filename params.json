From the console in the project root, execute \"mvn install\" (downloads Node, npm etc.)\r\n2. Import the project into your favorite IDE - Maven style\r\n3. From the console, write \"grunt server\" (starts the prototyping mode - based on Yeoman)\r\n4. To run e2e tests with Protractor - write \"grunt protractor\" (you will probably have to fix the port number and app path)\r\n5. Generate new angular controller \"yo angular:controller [XXX]\" (beware, this step needs improvement - there is some manual stuff to do)\r\n\r\nAt any time you can fire up the application in your favorite JEE6/7 container, but notice that the port number in the e2e tests\r\nare hard coded to 8080.\r\n\r\nHave fun :-)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
